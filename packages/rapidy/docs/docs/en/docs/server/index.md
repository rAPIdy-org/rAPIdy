# HTTP Server

## Description
`Rapidy` allows you to create high-performance web servers in `Python` that can receive, send, and
automatically validate any incoming or outgoing information.

A simple server can be launched in just a few lines of code:

```python
from rapidy import Rapidy, run_app
from rapidy.http import get

@get('/hello')
async def hello() -> dict[str, str]:
    return {'message': 'Hello, Web-Server!'}

rapidy = Rapidy(http_route_handlers=[hello])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    run_app(rapidy, host='0.0.0.0', port=8080)
```
